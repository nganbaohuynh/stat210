  # stat210

  The goal of stat210 is to provide data and functions for the NMBU course Stat 210.

## Installation

To get the current official version of **stat210**, install from CRAN as follows:
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("stat210")
```

Alternatively, the latest development version may be obtained from GitHub:

  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First install devtools if needed
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

# Install stat210 from GitHub
devtools::install_github("nganbaohuynh/stat210")
```
# Content

Currently **stat210** contains the data sets used in lectures and exercises of the course
